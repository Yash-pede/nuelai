### If I had more time, I would implement:

#### Performance & Data Optimization
- **Enhanced KPI visualizations** - Add infographic trend indicators comparing current vs previous month with percentage changes and arrow indicators
- **Smart pagination** - Fetch data according to current page instead of loading all products at once
- **Centralized state management** - Move date range selection logic to Redux for better state consistency across components
- **Transfer Stock Feature** - It was already mentioned in the pdf but i was not able to impliment it because of time 

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Product management** - Add ability to delete products with confirmation modals
- **Better loading states** - Implement skeleton loaders and more efficient error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Advanced filtering** - Add sorting, bulk operations, and saved filter presets

#### Additional Features Could add in Future
- Authentication & role-based access control
- Real-time updates via GraphQL subscriptions
- CSV/Excel export functionality
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Advanced analytics & demand forecasting
